# Elevate_labs_task_4
This project presents an interactive Business Insights Dashboard built using Power BI, based on a used car sales dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to identify key trends, pricing behavior, and regional performance to support data-driven decision-making.

1. Imported and cleaned the dataset (removed duplicates, fixed data types, converted date format).
2. Performed data modeling and created DAX measures for KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Price, Cars Sold, and Price Difference vs Market Value.
3. Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:
KPI Cards
Monthly Sales Trend
Sales by State
Top 10 Car Models
Filled Map Visualization
Mileage & Condition Impact Analysis
Added drill-down features for better user exploration.
4. Derived business insights and recommendations to improve sales strategy and inventory planning.
5. PPT for the stake holders explaining the financial analysis and recommendations.
